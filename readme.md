# Bikefty

Bikefty improves bikers' safety in many ways.

The app provides live information about roadblocks, such as: holes, fallen trees, wild animals, ice, high traffic and frequent accidents spots. This data is being uploaded live by users of our application. Users can see roadblocks ahead of them on a map. You can also see where the closest bike repair point is. Another feature is e-learning. You can complete lessons about safe bike riding and gain discounts for tourists spots in Lesser Poland.

Additionally, before you start your ride you can go through a control list of your bike's technical state and equipment.
